Database Normalization
----------------------

First normal form (1NF)
Each table has a primary key: minimal set of attributes which can uniquely identify a record.
The values in each column of a table are atomic (No multi-value attributes allowed).
There are no repeating groups: two columns do not store similar information in the same table.

Second normal form (2NF)
All requirements for 1st NF must be met.
No partial dependencies.
No calculated data.

Third normal form (3NF)
All requirements for 2nd NF must be met.
Eliminate fields that do not directly depend on the primary key; that is no transitive dependencies.
